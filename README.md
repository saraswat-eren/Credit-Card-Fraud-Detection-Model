Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

This repository presents a machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Utilizing Google Colab for development and data analysis, this project employs logistic regression as the primary model. 

Key Features:

* Data Analysis and Preprocessing: Comprehensive exploration and cleaning of credit card transaction data to ensure model accuracy.
* Logistic Regression Model: Implementation of a logistic regression model to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
* Performance Evaluation: Evaluation of the model's performance using relevant metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Technologies Used:

* Python
* Google Colab
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn

Project Goals:

* Develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately identifying fraudulent credit card transactions.
* Contribute to the prevention of financial losses for both banks and customers.
* Explore the potential of machine learning in the field of fraud detection.
